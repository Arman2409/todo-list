# To Do

Task management application

## Task implementation

You can find several bugs in the project, which I couldn't fix due to time limitations.For example you can find that the fields of the add/edit form are not being validated in proper order, or that dates are not properly inserted in the form when editing, 
deadline.The fact that I didn't have any prior experience with Formik and Yup was also a reason I couldn't handle this kind of bugs.
